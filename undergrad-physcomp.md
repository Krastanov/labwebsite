# CICS 256: Make: A Hands-on Introduction to Physical Computing

Inspired by the Maker movement, this course provides a hands-on introduction to physical computing: techniques for sensing and responding to the physical world using electronics and microcontrollers. The main focus is on learning principles of electronic components and circuits, embedded programming, product design, and rapid prototyping through hands-on learning. The course will encourage and empower students to invent, design, and build practical hardware projects that can interact with the physical world.

Specific topics: introduction to basic electronics and circuit design, microcontroller programming using Arduinos, sensing and responding to the physical world, and rapid prototyping techniques (such as 3D printing and laser cutting). There will be in-class experiments, weekly homework/quizzes, a midterm, and a final project. This course has a required lab section.

## Prerequisites

COMPSCI187 (or CICS210) and Basic Math Skills (R1). This course counts towards the CS lab science requirement. 4 credits.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. Explain fundamental concepts in basic electronics, including voltage, current, resistance, Ohm's law, and how to use basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors in simple circuits.

2. Develop a solid grasp of Arduino programming principles, including digital and analog input/output, digital-analog conversion, and serial communication. They will be able to create Arduino-based projects using the ESP32 Microcontroller.

3. Demonstrate proficiency in various circuit assembly and rapid prototyping techniques though assembling electronic components in circuits, soldering (perf board and surface mount), 3D printing, designing 3D models with TinkerCad, and utilizing laser cutting.

4. Collaborate in groups to design and build a practical hardware project that can interact with the physical world through a range of sensors and actuators.

## Grading

TBA

## Use of Tools (solvers, textbooks, AI, etc) during exams and for homework

As long as you disclose the use, you can use any **personal** tool you can think of to help with take-home exams and homework. That includes:

- textbooks
- search engines
- numerical or symbolic software
- AI language models and chat tools

However **you have to disclose** that you used such a tool. In particular, if you find a creative use of such a tool, you might be asked to demonstrate to the class the new technique you have discovered.

**Beware**, AI language models might very often produce absolute garbage nonsense while presenting it with a veneer of authority and certainty.

**You are not permitted to copy the work of another sentient being for any exam or homework.**

## Academic Honesty Statement

Copying of written homeworks, or exams or "teamwork" on an assignment (unless teaming is explicitly part of that assignment) is not permitted. You can talk to other students about the assignments, and ask/answer questions - it is great to learn from each other - but the work you hand in must be your own. A student found copying the work of others will receive a grade of F for the course. If you are having trouble with an assignment or if you are having trouble meeting a deadline, see the instructor or the TA; we will bend over backwards to help you but we will not tolerate cheating. Please read the [UMass Academic Code of Conduct Policy](https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct).

## Accommodation Statement

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all students.  If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course.  If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may make appropriate arrangements.  For further information, please visit [Disability Services](https://www.umass.edu/disability/).

## Title IX Statement

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits gender-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funds, the University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students, free from all forms of discrimination, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. This includes interactions in person or online through digital platforms and social media. Title IX also protects against discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or related conditions, including recovery. There are resources here on campus to support you. A summary of the available Title IX resources (confidential and non-confidential) can be found at [www.umass.edu/titleix/resources](https://www.umass.edu/titleix/resources). You do not need to make a formal report to access them. If you need immediate support, you are not alone. Free and confidential support is available 24 hours a day / 7 days a week / 365 days a year at the SASA Hotline 413-545-0800.
