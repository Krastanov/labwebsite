Here, we develop a simulation algorithm for distillation circuits with gate-simulation complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps, providing for drastically faster modeling compared to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ Clifford simulators or $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ wavefunction simulators over $n$ qubits. This new simulator made it possible to not only model but also optimize practically interesting purification circuits. It enabled us to use a simple discrete optimization algorithm to design purification circuits from $n$ raw Bell pairs to $k$ purified pairs and study the use of these circuits in the teleportation of logical qubits in second-generation quantum repeaters. The resulting purification circuits are the best-known purification circuits for finite-size noisy hardware and can be fine-tuned for specific hardware error models. Furthermore, we design purification circuits that shape the correlations of errors in the purified pairs such that the performance of the error-correcting code used in teleportation or other higher-level protocols is greatly improved. Our approach of optimizing multiple layers of the networking stack, both the low-level entanglement purification, and the forward error correction on top of it, are shown to be indispensable for the design of high-performance second-generation quantum repeaters.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01375v1">Quantum theory of single-photon nonlinearities generated by ensembles of emitters</a></h3> <p><em>Kurt Jacobs, Stefan Krastanov, Mikkel Heuck, Dirk R.

One critical hurdle in this endeavor is the lack of a comprehensive quantum theory of the generation of nonlinearities by ensembles of emitters. Distinct <small>... [click to read more]</small></summary> <p>approaches applicable to different regimes have yielded important insights: i) a semiclassical approach reveals that, for many-photon coherent fields, the contributions of independent emitters add independently allowing ensembles to produce strong optical nonlinearities via EIT; ii) a quantum analysis has shown that in the few-photon regime collective coupling effects prevent ensembles from inducing these strong nonlinearities. Rather surprisingly, experimental results with around twenty photons are in line with the semi-classical predictions. Theoretical analysis has been fragmented due to the difficulty of treating nonlinear many-body quantum systems. Here we are able to solve this problem by constructing a powerful theory of the generation of optical nonlinearities by single emitters and ensembles. The key to this construction is the application of perturbation theory to perturbations generated by subsystems. This theory reveals critical properties of ensembles that have long been obscure. The most remarkable of these is the discovery that quantum effects prevent ensembles generating single-photon nonlinearities only within the rotating-wave regime; outside this regime single-photon nonlinearities scale as the number of emitters. The theory we present here also provides an efficient way to calculate nonlinearities for arbitrary multi-level driving schemes, and we expect that it will prove a powerful foundation for further advances in this area.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11465v2">Near-term $n$ to $k$ distillation protocols using graph codes</a></h3> <p><em>Kenneth Goodenough, Sébastian de Bone, Vaishnavi L.

[click to read more]</small></summary> <p>we find strong evidence that a depth $O(\log N)$ random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel capacity, for any $D$. Previous results on random circuits have only shown that $O(N^{1/D})$ depth suffices or that $O(\log^3 N)$ depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity ($D \to \infty$). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with $N$. We find that the requisite depth scales like $O(\log N)$ only for dimensions $D \ge 2$, and that random circuits require $O(\sqrt{N})$ depth for $D=1$. Finally, we introduce an "expurgation" algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into additional stabilizers or gauge operators. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sub-logarithmic depth in $D\ge 2$ below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in $D=2$ dimensions.

Using just these two controls, one can construct arbitrary unitary operations, offering a scalable route to performing logical manipulations on oscillator-encoded qubits.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=publication > <div class=well > <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00194v4">Holonomic quantum control with continuous variable systems</a></h3> <p><em>Victor V.

First, we present four validation tests: spectra from simulations of thermal plasmas, linear growth rates of the relativistic tearing instability and <small>... [click to read more]</small></summary> <p>of the filamentation instability, and non-linear filamentation merging phase. For the filamentation instability we show that the effective growth rates measured on the total energy can differ by more than 50% from the linear cold predictions and from the fastest modes of the simulation. Second, we detail a new method for initial loading of Maxwell-J\"uttner particle distributions with relativistic bulk velocity and relativistic temperature, and explain why the traditional method with individual particle boosting fails. Third, we scrutinize the question of what description of physical plasmas is obtained by PIC models. These models rely on two building blocks: coarse-graining, i.e., grouping of the order of p~10^10 real particles into a single computer superparticle, and field storage on a grid with its subsequent finite superparticle size. We introduce the notion of coarse-graining dependent quantities, i.e., quantities depending on p. They derive from the PIC plasma parameter Lambda^{PIC}, which we show to scale as 1/p. We explore two implications. One is that PIC collision- and fluctuation-induced thermalization times are expected to scale with the number of superparticles per grid cell, and thus to be a factor p~10^10 smaller than in real plasmas. The other is that the level of electric field fluctuations scales as 1/Lambda^{PIC} ~ p. We provide a corresponding exact expression. Fourth, we compare the Vlasov-Maxwell theory, which describes a phase-space fluid with infinite Lambda, to the PIC model and its relatively small Lambda.</p> </details> </div> </div> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Stefan Krastanov.
