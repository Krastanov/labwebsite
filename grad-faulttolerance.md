Monolithic quantum hardware is reaching the limits of scalable fabrication, linking hardware module in local (single fridge) networks is becoming a practical possibility, error correcting codes much better than surface codes are being deployed and universal fault-tolerant computation on them is now a theoretically solved problem

It has never been more exciting to see all the pieces needed for scalable universal quantum computation coming together. This seminar will provide an overview of everything necessary for the complete fault tolerant architecture behind a quantum computer.

The first few weeks of this course will consist of introduction to classical and quantum error correction through lectures by the instructors. After the introduction is completed, we will transition to the seminar part of the course where students will be studying and presenting recent advancements in quantum error correction. The main focus would be on topological codes like the surface and toric codes, and on good quantum codes like the recently developed quantum LDPC codes.

Students can register for either:

- one credit section where student will be expected to study the various provided papers on the topic and make at least one class presentation on such paper;
- three credit section which includes the above requirements and, in addition, students will be expected to propose and complete a course project in consultation with the instructors

Students will be expected to fully participate in classroom discussions. Class time will be focused on:
- Short presentations by students
- QnA with students, led by the presenting student and moderated by instructors
- Each presenting student would be expected to discuss their presentation a week in advance with the instructors, in order to polish their presentation and get help on topics of interest. **It is the student's responsibility to sign up for office hours!!!**

Each paper presentation will be 20min followed by 10-15min of QnA. The presenter's goal should be to teach the audience about the concepts presented in the paper, why are they valuable, how they might be applied, etc. The 10-15min QnA would be managed by the instructors, who will also try to help with the thornier questions.

## Prerequisites

Students will need baseline understanding of quantum information science and error correction to productively participate in the class.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, it is expected that students will be able to:
- Simulate the performance of error correcting codes
- Design a variety of error correction circuits based on a given error correcting code
- Evaluate properties of error correcting codes analytically and numerically
- In particular, students will be comfortable with important classes of codes like Surface Codes and LDPC Codes

## Required Texts and Materials

A list of [general Quantum Information textbooks is made available](/quantumonboarding) and a list of [papers for each week will be provided in advance](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6052508/qeccfaulttolerancegradclass/library).

## Topics

We will aim to cover the following topics (numbers in parentheses indicate approximate number of 120-minute lectures for each topic):
- (1) [Introduction to error correcting codes and their decoding](basics)
- (1) [Compiling Arbitrary Circuits to Measurement-only Gatesets](pauli)
- (3) [Fault Tolerance for Topological Codes through Lattice Surgery](topo)
- (3) [Generalized Lattice Surgery](latsurgery)
- (2) [Code Automorphisms](automorph)
- (1) [Complete Architectures](arch)
